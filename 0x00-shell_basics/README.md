shell basics
In this project, I underwent an introductory crash course in the Shell. I learned how to navigate directories using cd, pwd, ls, how to look around using ls, less, and file, and how to manipulate files with cp, mv, rm, and mkdir. Further, I practiced working with the type, which, help, and man commands, implementing wildcards, reading man pages, creating links, and using keyboard shortcuts in Bash.
